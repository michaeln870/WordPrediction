# Capstone Project: Word Prediction Application

This project is a simple word prediction model that has been able to suggest words when someone is typing. A "Stupid Backoff" model is used to predict words based on a corpus of english text from HC Corpora.

Application: https://michaeln870.shinyapps.io/WordPrediction/

For more detailed information about the project, look at the:
- `Milestone-Report.md`: Report for part 1 of the project. It describes the data used, steps for data preparation and some exploratory data analysis.
- `Creating ngrams.ipynb`: R Codes using Sparklyr package to clean and transform a large text corpus on a Spark cluster.

I'm still currently working on the project. I'll be updating the repository regularly until the project is fully completed.

To do next:
- Implement different models (Maximum Likelihood Estimate, Katz Backoff, ...)
- Improve UI and add features

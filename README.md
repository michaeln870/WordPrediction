# WordPrediction
Capstone Project

**Work in progress**

Expected completion: before the end of March

I'm sorry, I was so excited to apply for jobs and was afraid to be too late for summer interships that I didn't have time to finish this project. I still wanted to show off what I can do in the likelihood that I finish it before anybody sees this.

In the mean time, you can look at `Preprocessing.ipynb` to look at my initial work, where I used the Sparklyr package in R to process and clean a large dataset.
I'll be updating the repository regularly until the project is completed.

Next I need to:
- Implement a Stupid Backoff scoring algorithm that will predict words
- Implement the algorithm into a Shiny app
- Test and optimize

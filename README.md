# Capstone Project: Word Prediction

This project aims at building a word prediction model able to intelligently suggest the next word that the user is most likely to type, similar to the SwiftKey keyboard phone application.

Prototype application: https://michaeln870.shinyapps.io/WordPrediction/

For more detailed information about the project, look at the:
- `Milestone-Report.md`: Report for part 1 of project (includes detail on data, data preparation and exploratory data analysis)  
- `Creating ngrams.ipynb`: R Codes using Sparklyr package to clean and transform a large text corpus on a Spark cluster.

This project is still a work in progress.  
Expected completion: before the end of March

To do next:
- Implement a scoring model (Stupid Backoff, ...)
- Build a system to display more suggestions based on scores
- Improve UI and add features
- Test and optimize

I'll be updating the repository regularly until the project is completed.
